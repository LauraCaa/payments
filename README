**Payments Table**
This is a simple project that shows a table of payment methods using React. Payment details are loaded from a local JSON file, and presented in a table with details such as the cardholderâ€™s name, the last 4 digits of the card, and its status as "Primary" if applicable.

**Project structure**
index.html: Contains the basic structure of the page, including the container where the React component will be mounted.
payments.json: JSON file containing the payment method information (this file must be available for the project to work properly).
styles.css: File of styles that defines the appearance of the table and other visual elements.
JavaScript React: The application logic code is written in JSX and transcrated into the browser using Babel.

**Technologies**
React: Used to build the user interface in a declarative way.
Babel: Allows you to use JSX in the browser and transfile it to standard JavaScript.
CSS: Basic styles to improve the presentation.
